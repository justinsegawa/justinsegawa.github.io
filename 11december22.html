                    As mentioned in the previous blog post, I slowed many weapons and other abilities down so that players
                    could take more time processing the rest of the game as well as incoming attacks from the enemy ship. 
                    I also adjusted some values that were not up to date with documentation.

                <p>
                    The most important takeaway from this semester with WolverineSoft was the dynamics of a large development team.
                    Diversifying into multiple different departments resulted in so many more features and content, but also led 
                    to many challenges with communication. Documentation proved more important than ever before, but even then 
                    many topics or ideas were lost in the sea of messages. The importance of communication isn't new but visiting it
                    from a new perspective was valuable.
                    <br></br>
                    Gaining experience with dev tools--Figma and Unity--was also a great reward. Although I wish the designers 
                    could have received an introduction to these tools even earlier in the process, I'm very grateful to the 
                    project leads who took the time to show us the ropes.  
                </p>

                    <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Approximate hours breakdown:</h3>
                    <p>In all honesty, I wrote my previous blogpost as if it was the final one and did not realize
                        that THIS one was the actual last one. As such I did not track hours as meticulously but made 
                        sure to finish strong with my contributions. 
                    </p>
