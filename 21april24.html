                <h2 class="sectionheader">Final Sprint (4/7/24 to 4/21/24)</h2>
                <p>Final sprint focused on bug fixing and polish updates.</p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Task 1: Resize Child Sprite</h3>
                <p>
                    The young child encountered throughout the game, Ollei, was a little bit too small in the overworld. This task was conceptually
                    simple, just increasing the sprite size, but it did involve being thorough. Some cutscenes and world positions could break or look awkward
                    with the new size. I was not in charge of fixing those specific cutscenes, but I playtested every scene with Ollei to double-check these.  
                    Changing Ollei's prefab also didn't reflect in-game, so I needed to manually enlargen him in each scene. A merge conflict also obliterated
                    the sprite changes so I also got to speedrun the sprite changes and testing a second time.
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Task 2: Mob Cutscene Improvements</h3>
                <p>
                    The return to cutscenes and the Unity Timeline. I worked on 2 separate cutscenes:
                    <li>An angry mob of villagers chases the player out of their village</li>
                    <li>That same mob tries to drive the player out when the player returns to their now-destroyed village</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <video controls width="500">
                        <source src="mob_initial.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                    <video controls width="500">
                        <source src="mob_revisit.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video> 
                    <br></br>
                    In the initial version of the first cutscene, only 3 villagers approached the player and gave chase. I added more villagers to
                    fill up the screen and accost the player, and each of them chases too! Unfortunately villager run cycles were out
                    of scope, but the villagers definitely feel more like a mob. On top of animating the chase and playtesting the cutscene, I also
                    fixed some bugs such as villagers sharing Animation Controllers with Ollei by default -- suddenly the kid would age into a grown man
                    in totally separate cutscenes!
                    <br></br>
                    My goal for the second cutscene was mostly the same, as only a single villager represented the mob so far. This cutscene was relatively
                    lighter since the villagers only needed to walk into frame, but it still required some debugging including preventing the animal
                    squad from being interactable too early. I also pointed out that the animals sort of trample over the crowd at the end of the
                    cutscene (as in the video), so in the following meeting I was also assigned adding a fade to black transition and I implemented that
                    as well.
                    <br></br>
                    These two cutscenes easily took up the bulk of my commitment this sprint. My honest feelings -- working with the Unity Timeline can be
                    very finicky, and definitely very time-consuming. I would've preferred to lean into my programming role more, but on the bright side
                    breathing life into cutscenes felt rewarding in its own way.   
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Task 3: Bug Jam</h3>
                <p>
                    Less of a concrete task and more a debugging session, our leads Allie and Leo invited the programming and QA team to a bug jam.
                    Almost everyone showed up which was very cool! We spent the session finding and squashing bugs with each other. Notable bugs I worked
                    on were a hardlock(!) bug after losing a battle against the Deer Council, and spamming the space bar too quickly either softlocking or
                    leading to repeated dialogue.
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Task 4: Final Bug Reports</h3>
                <p>
                    The final task for Project Quest (now Soul of the Forest) was a final bug search and report. Anyone
                    who could contribute before our game showcase played through the game looking for as many issues as possible,
                    including ones that were known but never formally reported, and logged them while fixing them if possible.
                    Bugs I logged included the Mega Hit (player's special move) not charging or activating when it should, visual novel sprites
                    disappearing altogether when pressing space too quickly, and one funny "bug":
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="forgotten_squirrel.png"> 
                    <br><br>
                    The Forest scene has a squirrel hidden so far behind some trees that no one remembered it existed, so it still has a placeholder
                    old man sprite in both the overworld and dialogue! Guess we forgot where we buried the squirrel.
                </p>
