                <p>This semester's first sprint lasts 3 weeks instead of 2.</p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    I returned to WolverineSoft Studio after more than a year, this time as a programmer! My class schedule finally allowed me to rejoin
                    the student-run game studio, and I'm excited to apply what I've learned in the past year to this project. 
                    <br></br>
                    This semester I'm working on <strong>Project Quest</strong>, an original RPG inspired by <em>Undertale</em> and <em>Franken</em>.
                    Since Project Quest is in its 2nd semester of development, the main challenge of this sprint was getting integrated into a large, existing
                    codebase throughout all my tasks.
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Task 1: Throne Room Cutscene Revamp</h3>
                <p>
                    Project Quest features various cutscenes in the overworld, and my first task was focused on improving aesthetics and squashing bugs
                    in the "throne room" cutscene; the protagonist, a druid, confronts the tyrannical king in the penultimate scene of the game:
                    <br><br>
                    <video controls>
                        <source src="throneroomjanky.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                      </video> 
                    <br><br>
                    There's definitely a lot to be desired from this cutscene, and I came to the conclusion that it could not reach a polished state through
                    code improvements alone, though that wasn't for lack of trying. 
                    <br><br>
                    The main blocker was the lack of transition. 
                    Since nothing separates the throne room from the preceding hallway, the player may not be in the center of the screen when they trigger
                    the cutscene. To compensate, the current implemetation teleports the player to the center of the tiled pathway and the camera makes
                    a jagged snap to follow. If there was a door, or the throne room existed in a separate Unity scene altogther, we could re-align
                    the player during some kind of scene transition, like a fade-to-black. 
                    <br><br>
                    I explained this to the overworld team and my lead, and learned that both the throne room and the castle containing it were receiving
                    a layout and design revamp in the next sprint. As a result, this task is on hold for now.

                        This dropdown details all my attempts at improving the throne room cutscene, and why they did not 
                        make it into the master branch.
                        <br><br>
                        Animation: the druid lacks a walk cycle animation when approaching the king. I actually fixed this issue by forcing 
                        a walking boolean to "true" in the Unity animator, and changed the "resting" sprite of the druid such that
                        it no longer stopped in front of the king mid-step. However the druid (player) would end the cutscene facing some unintended direction
                        with this method...
                        <br><br>
                        Druid facing wrong direction: The original
                        implementation of the cutscene did not make the player walk, but instead generated a separate GameObject with the druid's sprite
                        just for the cutscene. Thus, once the game refocused on the <i>real</i> player after the cutscene, they would be facing whatever
                        direction they were looking from before of the cutscene, which could be in an awkward (straight left or right).
                        I found that the player's directional movement script determined the direction they face. I did make two attempts at
                        overriding this, and considered tinkering with the player controls script. Unfortunately the former did not succeed and I 
                        decided against the latter after realizing how awful of an idea that was.
                        <br><br>
                        Camera snapping: To reiterate, this cutscene generates a second druid just for the cutscene.
                        The camera would snap to this new object at the beginning of the cutscene, but <i>snap back</i> to the real player after, causing
                        glaring visuals bugs. By this point I ran out of time to work on a solution, but considering the overall revamp I would like to 
                        re-implement this cutscene without creating a "copy" of the player.
                    </div>
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Task 2: Final Battle Cutscene</h3>
                <p>
                    The player faces the true antagonist of the game, an evil "hero", immediately after confronting the king. There was no cutscene 
                    implemented yet, so dialogue would begin abruptly. I completed this task with a lot more success:
                    <br></br>
                    <video controls>
                        <source src="finalherocutscene.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                      </video> 
                    <br></br>
                    As the player exits the throne room, the hero simply walks up to the player from off-screen. The hero does not stop directly in front of
                    the player, but a simple fix would be adding the aforementioned transitions in and out of the throne room so that the player 
                    aligns with the hero.
                    <br></br>
                    I used Unity's Timeline functionality for the first time and learned a great deal. I tinkered with pre-existing Signal Receivers and 
                    got into Unity's animator as well. At the same time, I experienced a lot of friction learning functionality for the first time, and I 
                    also spent a large chunk of time understanding the pre-existing cutscene implementation.
                    I honestly didn't expect this kind of task, since it involved far more animation and in-editor work 
                    than programming, but I still expanded my understanding of Unity as a whole.
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Task 3: Final <i>Battle</i></h3>
                <p>
                    Continued from the cutscene, the actual final battle itself would not trigger, even though the implementation existed. The fix turned out
                    to be extremely simple. The following command was originally empty from the dialogue-to-battle flow: 
                    <br></br>
                    <img src="hero_battle_ineditor.png"> 
                    <br></br>
                    However, I ended up spending an embarrassing length of time on this issue. The above Runtime Only function appears about 6 clicks deep
                    in the inspector, somewhat hidden within a Dialogue Controller object; in Project Quest, 
                    <strong>dialogue leads to battles leads to dialogue.</strong>
                    It felt like of those things that are really easy to find 
                    once you know where it is, but if you don't...
                    <br><br>
                    I found the final battle prefab and the function to trigger it within the first hour of working on this task, but I simply had no
                    idea it ran the way it did. I attempting debugging, scouring components for reference, analyzing how previous battles trigger,
                    but over the course of multiple hours I never thought to look in the Hero's Dialogue Controller.
                    <br></br>
                    ...For whatever reason, I also never thought to <i>ask</i> a fellow programmer with prior experience on the codebase. Once I finally 
                    did so, we solved the issue within an hour. This should be a lesson I've already learned...but asking for help goes a long way
                    when working with new codebases.
