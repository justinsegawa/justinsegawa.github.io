                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    A little bit of an irregular week, but also less stressful, with Thanksgiving break mixed in. 
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Final Balancing</h3>
                <p>
                    After pushing patch notes at the end of last sprint, I spent the week focusing more on how the game 
                    <emph>felt</emph> to play. At team meetings I received feedback that the game still felt too "fast" or overwhelming. 
                    Players felt the need to constantly fire and shoot their weapons, with even less downtime than FTL. 
                    <br></br>
                    As a potential solution with the remaining time that we have, I am experimenting with a universal 
                    cooldown time increase for all weapons, and then adjusting specific weapons from there. 
                    These changes will be included in the final patch notes of the game. 
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Wrapping up</h3>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately the timing for this blog post just barely misses the final week of work on Project: Light,
                    and the Thanksgiving break means a lot less to go over. However, I plan on updating this blog one last time
                    with the final changes contributed the game, as well as closing thoughts and a reflection on the project!
