                    In a team of 4, we created an educational game for children on the Autism spectrum.
                    The end goal was to share these games with local children at the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, but unfortunately COVID-19 interfered with that semester.

                <p class="sectioncontent">We created Hotshot Horizons, a game teaching players the fundamentals of basketball while helping them get used to constructive feedback.
                    In each level, a virtual coach character helps the player acquire a new basketball skill or practice a previous skill. 
                    When the player hits a shot or makes a mistake, the coach provides corresponding audio and visual feedback. 
                    In later levels, NPC teammates and opponents come into play, culminating in a final "championship game" in which the player uses all of their skills to win. 
                </p>    
                <p class="sectioncontent">Each team member participated in every step of the development process, such as art, programming, and documentation.
                    I contributed extensively to programming player actions and NPC interaction, as well as designing educational gameplay loops.
