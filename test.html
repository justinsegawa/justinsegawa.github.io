            <p class="sectioncontent">Hi, my name is Justin Segawa. I'm a 4th year student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. 
                I'm into game design and programming I love both card games and video games and play competitively, but I am also passionate about exploring how my favorite games are designed. I’m also fluent in Japanese and studying Chinese. On this site you can find out about my latest projects, coursework, and more.

            <h3 class="sectionsubheader">EECS281: Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
            <p class="sectioncontent">User-centered research, design, and development, especially for UI/UX and web design. 
                Introduction to data structures and algorithms with C++. Algorithms covered in EECS281 include sorting algorithms, binary search, binary heaps, BFS and DFS, shortest path        algorithms, the traveling salesperson problem, and dynamic programming. 
                Projects in EECS281:
                <ul class="sectioncontent">
                <li><b>Back to the Ship</b>: developed routing schemes using stacks and queues and simulated an escape from a space station represented by various tiles, such as floor and elevator tiles.</li> 
                <li><b>Zombie Invasion</b>: used priority queues to simulate a zombie siege and the student's defenses. The program may also print various statistics, such as a running median.</li>   
                <li><b>Log Manager</b>: implemented a log manager using hash maps that can handle various search requests.</li> 
                <li><b>Zookeeper</b>: implemented MST algorithms and a traveling salesperson solution using branch-and-bound and heuristics, optimizing food and water delivery for a virtual zoo.</li> 
                </ul>

                <div><p class= "sectioncontent">Introduction to fundamental programming, technical communication, and the game development process. In teams of 4, students created simple educational games for children on the Autism spectrum. The end goal was to share these games with local children at the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, but unfortunately we were unable to do so due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

                <p class="sectioncontent">We created Hotshot Horizons, a game teaching players the fundamentals of basketball while helping them get used to constructive feedback. In each level, a virtual coach character helps the player acquire a new basketball skill or practice a previous skill. When the player hits a shot or makes a mistake, the coach provides corresponding audio and visual feedback. In later levels, AI teammates and opponents come into play, culminating in a final "championship game" in which the player uses all of their skills to win. Our team wrote an extensive reference manual, available at this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KYQhij25II6VLpfXiK5vAFFQxic3It0I_ezwgbZsbEk/edit?usp=sharing">link</a>.
                </p>    
                <p class="sectioncontent">Each team member participated in every step of the development process, such as art, programming, and documentation. I contributed extensively to programming player actions and NPC interaction, as well as designing educational gameplay loops.
