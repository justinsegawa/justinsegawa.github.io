                <p>Due to spring break this blog post covers just one week.</p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Task 1: Fungi Minigame</h3>
                <p>
                    The Forest area of Project Quest features a dancing minigame. The player must repeat after a mushroom's dance moves and
                    convince them to join their cause.
                    <br><br>
                    <video controls width="500">
                        <source src="fungi_dance.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video> 
                    <br><br>
                    I fixed a bug where dialogue repeated too many times and adjusted the sprites' dancing speeds so players can better digest
                    the minigame's objective.
                    <br><br>
                    A more interesting part of the task was figuring out other ways to make the minigame immediately understandable. I felt that
                    the dialogue immediately preceding could use some changes:
                    <br></br>
                    <img src="fungi_1.png"> 
                    <br></br>
                    <img src="fungi_2.png"> 
                    <br></br>
                    If the fungi's last line was something like "repeat after me" or "I'll show you", the dialogue could carry the teaching. 
                    I ran this by my programming lead and got the go ahead to change it since it was temp dialogue to begin with!
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Task 2: Deer Collisions and Hitboxes</h3>
                <p>
                    My other task was also relatively mundane, fixing a strange interaction where the player could walk over/inside NPC sprites
                    and making sure the player could interact with those NPC from believable angles. I took the initiative to spend some extra time
                    adjusting other sprites that weren't listed in the original task, if I came across collisions during playtesting.
                    <br></br>
                    While finishing up this task, I inadvertently found a critical softlock bug:
                    <br></br>
                    <video controls width="500">
                        <source src="deer_convo_bug.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    </video> 
                    <br></br>
                    Spamming the interact key through this dialogue leads to the dialogue repeating itself as the player enters a battle scene,
                    and progression gets stuck after the battle. I looked into the bug a little bit, then reported it to the team and volunteered
                    to take it on next week.
