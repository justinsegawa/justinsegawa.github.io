                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    This is my first blog post ever as a designer for WolverineSoft, covering the majority of the pre-alpha sprint for 
                    our game, Project: Light. I will cover my experiences, contributions, and challenges I face as a game designer on a 
                    larger-scale project team for the first time.
                    <br></br>
                    Over the last 2 weeks, I familiarized myself with design tools such as Figma and began ideating on Project Light's
                    combat systems. I also started learning more about the structure and implications of working on a 20+ person team. 
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">But before that...what is Project: Light?</h3>
                <p>
                    Project: Light is an original game developed by the WolverineSoft team as a case study of FTL: Faster than Light. 
                    In the summer 2022 semester, an earlier team prototyped and created a minimum viable product (MVP) version of Project: Light.
                    This version featured the framework for ship customization and ship vs. ship combat. For the fall 2022 semester, our goal is to
                    flesh out Project: Light and create a 25-30 minute gameplay experience. 
                    <br></br>
                    I am a Content and Combat designer on the Project: Light team, and during this sprint I worked on iterating different combat
                    systems. 
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Week 1: Shield and Medbay</h3>
                <p>
                    The first set of systems I worked on were the pre-existing shield and medbay systems. Both systems functioned as of 
                    the MVP release, but only as default, "level 1" versions. I came up with 3 variations on each system, each with
                    different functionality, as well as upgrade tiers for both systems.
                    <br></br>

                    <br></br>
                    However, the above image represents a clear flaw in my approach. I was unsure how to best <em>visually</em> represent my ideas, 
                    and did not double check if there was an expectation to do so. Looking back, I was also slightly overwhelemd by the ideation
                    step itself. Thankfully, I quickly caught my footing the following week.
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionsubheader">Week 2: Weapons</h3>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of this week, our project lead, Cameron, and our design lead, Kelly, held an additional meeting to
                    help each designer better represent their work. They raised my standards for my own documentation, and helped me realize how 
                    extra clarity goes a long way in enabling the other sub-teams. During my previous game design experience, I worked in a much 
                    smaller team and each member played a significant part in all of programming, audio, and art. I had not yet internalized how 
                    much more I needed to focus on communication in my designs.
                    <br></br>

                    <br></br>
                    <em>"The Fish Bomb passes through enemy shields, and is about to collide with the enemy shield room."</em>
                    <br></br>
                    I created 3 new weapons for the player, and I picked up Figma for graphic design. I created images detailing the "lifespan" 
                    of each weapon, from firing to collision with the enemy ship. I also added narrative captions describing each image. 
                    I still have significant room for improvement, but my documentation conveys my ideas much more clearly than before, and I am
                    excited to see them implemented. An additional goal for next week is to revamp my previous shield and medbay designs using
                    a similar method.
